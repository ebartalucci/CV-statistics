Here is a list of possible updates to implement in the forseenable future:
1. Parse Github account and extract data
2. Open and read data 
3. Store data info (e.g. number of lines per code) and divide them according to code
4. Reshuffle data to be easy to manipulate
5. Extract statistics in the form of a pie chart of types of programming languages and number of lines coded as an inset
6. implement an eventual dynamical update of the Git every x commits
7. Interface python code with LaTEX CV document
8. Plot statistics on LaTEX
